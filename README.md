# blogs
A collection of the code that supports the blogs I will be writing with the intention of exploring computational social sciences: mixing humanities, arts and STEM into my projects.

The first project is titled "*Can the design of cities promote social cohesion?*" and I will be using differential equations, ABMs and GIS data to try and quantify my research to come to a more empirical conclusion. 

My intention from this is to be able to work on my "*Corrupt & Stupid*" idea before university.
