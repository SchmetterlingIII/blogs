    "# How the design of cities can promote social cohesion\n",
    "I am currently writing a blog post on the accumulation of research into the effect of design on the social cohesion of a community. To supplement this, there were computational models that I wished to include - which will take place here. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Introduction From Blog Post:**\n",
    "\n",
    "People are often coined as the *products of their environment* and tend to replicate that which is shown to them. As there is an increasing tend towards polarisation within communities and the alienation of individuals from some shared identity, is it possible for the design of an area to counter-act that. Does the environment in which you live cause you to act in a certain way? Is it possible to design an area to promote social cohesion?\n",
    "\n",
    "I've personally been interested in this through looking at cycles of deprivation, the evolution of cities and the general changing attitudes felt by people societally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, I will be presenting the accumulation of research that I have been doing into this to try and qualify this research - and come to some conclusion. For the context, I will not be directly tackling the issue but, in the demonstration of research, try to explore what has lead me to come to the conclusion of my design.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be exploring themes of architectural psychology, philosophy (namely ethics), systems engineering and mathematical modelling/computational physics in an attempt to come up with some applied “solution”."

    "As an end goal, I would like to have a relatively complex model of a community and see how the implementation of different concepts - third places embedded within the community that people are \"forced\" to go to - can cause an increase in familiarity between people, and thus helps the development of friends in urban areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "More detail on my concept will be in the blog, this will explore how a simple model of this can be approximated to have an inference of how this can be applied in real life -- as well as developing my own mathematical abilities and computational intuitions. "

    "Would like to compare people's interactions within shopping of my proposed scheme and existing public centres (and the way that shops are distributed to maximise profits almost exclusively). My suggestion is to make this experience such that random interactions are implicitly welcomed in the design of these areas (whilst I can market this as fiscal localism for the designs).\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of the models (mine against existing) each person has a certain destination in mind - although each person has randomised weights, such as some preferring to window shop and travel more freely whilst others are in a rush. I can further assign weights to the shops where this occurs more frequently as well (I'm assuming appointment based locations wouldn't be part of the pop-up design since the interaction aspect could cause conflict).\n",
    "\n",
    "From this, I can see the parameters that allow people to gain familiarity of each other within an environment and what aspects of the model can be changed to maximise this (including random noise and other aspects (like the percieved safety of an area and other points to research)).\n",
